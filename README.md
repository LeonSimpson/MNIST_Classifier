# MNIST Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network Classifier

This Python script demonstrates the training of a multilayer classifier on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.\
The trained model is saved to a .pth file, this can be later loaded for inference or further training.\
Performance with the default configuration is normally ~98%
